# java-histogram
I created this Java program in my Java Programming II course at ACC. This program allows the user to modify the brightness and contrast of an image. It also displays the color values in a histogram format. The Java files were created by my professor, Richard Baldwin. The task of the assignment was to modify the Histogram.java file so that the program output would match that of proj11c.jpg and proj11d.jpg (proj11a.jpg and proj11b.jpg were the outputs of the original Histogram.java file). I was able to achieve the desired output by adding a new function in lines 537-570 of Histogram.java.
